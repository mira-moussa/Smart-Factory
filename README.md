# Smart-Factory
The main idea of the project is to convert a prototype of a factory to be fully automated, monitored, and controlled by IoT with three main elements: Raspberry Pi, PLC s71200, and Cloud server. We built two robot arms using DYNAMIXEL RX64 servos for the arms and DYNAMIXEL AX-12A servos for grippers. Then we calculated forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and trajectory to make the two robot arms accomplish the required motion in the pick and place process.
